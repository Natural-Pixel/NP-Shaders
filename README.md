### Welcome!

This is my own modified version of the Cinetools LUT shader created by Prod80.
I've added Preprocessor Definitions support for [my ReShade presets](https://www.patreon.com/NaturalPixel).

Many thanks to Prod80 for creating all these fantastic shaders and allowing modifications and sharing of them!
